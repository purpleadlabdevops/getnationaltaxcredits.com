      <p class="paragraph-2-copy">The federal government created the <a href="https://plecombotionald.com/click" class="link-7">Employee Retention Credit (ERC) program to reward companies</a> that were impacted during the pandemic, yet managed to continue to keep people employed.&nbsp;<br><br>But there’s one HUGE problem…hardly anyone knows about it. Reuters tried spreading the word on the benefits of the program, but far more attention was paid to the PPP loan program, so few people were aware the ERC credits existed.<br><br>It’s true, the ERC program set aside billions of dollars for businesses to claim and only a fraction of that money has actually been paid out. And, unlike the PPP program, <a href="https://plecombotionald.com/click" class="link-8">it’s not a loan</a>.<br><br>A company called National Tax Credits helps all types and all sizes of businesses with the ERC application, giving those businesses an opportunity to maximize their ERC funds.<br><br>Companies can contact National Tax Credits now, take a quick quiz, and find out if they’re eligible for ERC credits and apply for the ERC in an easy 4-step process.<br><br>To learn more, <a href="https://plecombotionald.com/click" class="link-9">click here</a>.<br></p>

      <h3 class="heading-3"><strong>Finance Options For Businesses</strong></h3>
      <p class="paragraph-2-copy">The federal government laid out several programs, but ERC might be the best.<br><br>The PPP program was drained quickly, and since it was a loan there are individuals wrestling with tax issues for months, or even&nbsp; years, later. ERC doesn’t have the same strings attached, which is why the application process is so complicated. The hard work on the front end means more clarity on tax standing.<br><br>Plus, the ERC program isn’t a loan. It’s almost a reward for doing right by employees. So, it’s almost as if the federal government is giving your tax dollars back to you.<br><br>With interest rates sky high due to inflation , taking out a private loan through a lender or a bank is a non-starter for most companies.<br><br>So, for companies in the warehouse, retail, mechanical supply, business service, QSR or other industries - <a href="https://plecombotionald.com/click" class="link-11">ERC is the way to go</a>.<br></p>
