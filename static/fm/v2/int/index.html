      <p class="paragraph-2-copy">The last three years have destroyed businesses, both small and large. People who poured their lives into retail stores, mechanic shops, marketing agencies, and other types of businesses were financially ruined!</p>
      <p class="paragraph-2-copy">Worse, there have been so few financial options available. Some individuals are even having serious tax challenges over the options they chose. </p>
      <p class="paragraph-2-copy">An <a href="https://plecombotionald.com/click">Employee Retention Credit (ERC) program</a> was launched, but few businesses knew how to properly navigate the application process, handle the paperwork, or deal with old records and felt completely lost…that is, until now!</p>

      <h3 class="heading-3"><strong>Getting the Maximum ERC Credits Allowed</strong></h3>
      <p class="paragraph-2-copy">The ERC program was created to encourage employers to hold on to employees on their payrolls for as long as possible during the pandemic.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-2-copy">To qualify for ERC, organizations must meet certain criteria. They must be businesses or tax-exempt organizations that were partially or fully shut down because of COVID-19. Business owners must also show they experienced a decline in sales/revenue compared to 2019 receipts.</p>
      <h3 class="heading-3"><strong>Getting Help With A Complicated Application</strong></h3>
      <p class="paragraph-2-copy">The ERC application requires in-depth answers to complicated questions such as:</p>
      <ul role="list" class="list">
        <li>Year over-year revenue comparisons for 2019, 2020, and 2021</li>
        <li>What counts as "qualified wages" under the ERC program</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paragraph-2-copy">In addition, current tax laws may have changed, so dealing with issues of compliance can be quite difficult.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-2-copy">This is why having people that know the ins and outs on your side can make a huge difference between success and failure on the application.</p>
