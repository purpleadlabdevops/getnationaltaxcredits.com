      <h2>What is the Employee <br> Retention Credit?</h2>
      <p>The Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERC) is a refundable tax credit designed to reward business owners for retaining employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, many business owners are receiving bad advice on how they qualify. The ERC is still the most powerful incentive available but it must be appropriately documented and calculated. To ensure you are asking the right questions while choosing a provider, it is critical to understand the most common misunderstandings surrounding this credit.</p>
